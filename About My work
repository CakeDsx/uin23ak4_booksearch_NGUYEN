I wasnt too sure if i understood the having a file called "searchresults" inside of "bookcard" i might have overthouhgt it and i proceeded to make a file named "searchresults" and added it in to a folder called "bookcard"

i tried to also do the extra oppgave by routing, but i was unfortunately not able to get there

my updates are all quite at the same time and that is because i used a test file to work on my project before proceeding to apply everything in to the main repositry, (its called test5 and is also public if u need proof of my work from there)
i made a few changes to improve it and make it look nicer. 

i struggled a little bit in the beginning but i managed to work stuff out by looking at the projects the teachers as made and by just looking up simple things on websites like overstack.

there are some ";" some places i believe ill be trying to remove as many as possible but since the auto import adds it by itsself, i might have missed some there
